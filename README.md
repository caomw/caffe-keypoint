Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.
It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center ([BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu)) and community contributors.

This is my fork of Caffe that implements layers, examples, and other functionality for training and evaluating networks for object pose, keypoint estimation.

Check out the [project site](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org) for
